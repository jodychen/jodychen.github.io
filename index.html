            <p>Increasingly, people are having secular mindfulness training marketed to them; they need help and easier access to true places to learn. Buddhist centers need a way to show their openness to unaffiliated practitioners, learners, and others curious about Buddhism. For the new practitioner, there’s a great deal of confusion with different traditions, languages, and a seemingly unlimited number of centers.  It can become overwhelming.</p>
