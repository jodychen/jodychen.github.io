            </h2>
            <p>Jaala will connect Buddhist practitioners of all traditions through an easy to use cloud-based software application. This software features a front end and a back end. Through the browser-based back end, practice centers may fill in a series of templates, uploading information about their tradition, locations, open sitting hours, required orientations, etc.  These templates, once complete and published, are available to the general public in an app available on Apple and Android.</p>
            <p>A MVP of the app is complete.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>The Big Lotus is a New York City based non-profit organization developing tools and resources to support the Buddhist community. Locally, we organize Buddhist-themed book clubs, temple tours, meditation classes, and museum trips. As an official partner of the Buddhist Council of New York, we are also developing app-based resources like a Buddhist center finder and an integrated Buddhist dictionary. Aside from aiming to better connect the Buddhist community, we are especially committed to helping anyone exploring Buddhist teachings navigate their own spiritual path.</p>
            <p>For the first time in (Buddhist) history, all traditions have the chance to encounter and interact with each other. Combining our extensive volunteering experiences with our technical expertise, Big Lotus aspires to build connections between groups and individuals from all Buddhist traditions.</p>

            <p><strong>Jane: </strong>After a small introduction in a yoga class, Jane has developed an active interest in learning about more Buddhism, meditation, and mindfulness. Jane can use the app to find local practice centers, learn what each center offers, and choose an appropriate place to visit. Jane can also easily locate and explore sanghas in the many different traditions to discover what flavor of Buddhist teachings would resonate most for her.</p>
            <p><strong>Robert: </strong>Robert is an established Buddhist practitioner, but he’s new to New York City. He also travels for a living. Robert can use the app to easily sort and find local sanghas in his own tradition in his new hometown, and on the road.</p>
            <p><strong>Emptiness Zen Center: </strong>Emptiness is a small, new Zendo looking to grow its community.  Budgets are limited, but with Jaala they can easily load all of their vital information into the app and to connect with folks who may be looking for them.  They can also easily use the app to locate local sanghas for community activity purposes. For example, community organizer user(s) can arrange events with multiple centers (e.g., Vesak celebration, community service programs, etc.).</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Increasingly, people are having secular mindfulness training marketed to them; they need help and easier access to true places to learn. Buddhist centers need a way to show their openness to unaffiliated practitioners, learners, and others curious about Buddhism. For the new practitioner, there’s a great deal of confusion with different traditions, languages, and a seemingly unlimited number of centers.  It can become overwhelming.</p>
